# Portland Cement Industry Regulation Analysis

This repository contains code and simulated data for replicating key analyses from Ryan (2012) "The Costs of Environmental Regulation in a Concentrated Industry" published in Econometrica. The analysis examines how the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments affected market structure and welfare in the US Portland cement industry.

## Repository Contents

- `econ8210replication.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the replication code written in Python.
- `cement_data.csv`: Simulated dataset containing plant-level production and capacity data (1980-1998).
- `econ8210replicationreport_meakin.pdf`: Report explaining the replication methodology and discussion.
- `Ryan_The Costs.pdf`: Original published paper being replicated.

## Analysis Overview

The code replicates the following key analyses:

1. Investment Policy Functions (Tables 6 & 7)
   - Estimates how firms adjust capacity
   - Separate analysis for pre/post 1990 periods

2. Entry/Exit Analysis (Table 8) 
   - Models firm entry and exit decisions
   - Examines impact of regulatory changes

3. Dynamic Parameters (Table 9)
   - Estimates structural parameters of the model
   - Quantifies changes in entry costs and other factors
